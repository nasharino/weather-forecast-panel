# Weather Forecast Panel

A small Python application that will display a weather forecast panel using data from a remote weather API.

Planned features:
- Fetch current weather and forecast data via HTTP API calls
- Simple terminal or GUI panel to display key information (temperature, conditions, etc.)
- Clear separation between API client code and presentation layer
